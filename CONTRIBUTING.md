# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in SIGIL.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Make your changes and keep them focused.
4. Run tests: `forge test` and `npm test`.
5. Open a pull request with a clear summary and screenshots if UI changed.

## Style

- Keep changes scoped and avoid unrelated formatting.
- Use existing patterns in `src/` and `contracts/`.
