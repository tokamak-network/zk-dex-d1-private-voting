And since voters can change their keys, the coordinator cannot prove anyone\'s final vote to a third party. Only aggregate results (total For/Against) are published.',
      q2: 'How much does it cost to use?',
      a2: 'Currently free on Sepolia testnet. On Ethereum mainnet, each proof batch costs approximately 300K gas. Voters pay a small gas fee per vote transaction.',
      q3: 'How many voters can participate?',
      a3: 'Up to 1,024 voters per poll in production configuration (state tree depth 10). The current testnet runs at depth 2 (max 4 voters) and will be expanded for mainnet.',
      q4: 'Has the code been audited?',
      a4: 'The codebase is fully open source (MIT license) with 116+ automated tests and 7 cryptographic security properties verified. Built on Ethereum PSE MACI research. Community audit and formal audit are planned before mainnet.',
      q5: 'Which blockchains are supported?',
      a5: 'Currently deployed on Ethereum Sepolia testnet. Ethereum mainnet is the primary target. Multi-chain support (Base, Arbitrum) is planned.',
      q6: 'What if someone forces me to vote a certain way?',

      desc: 'Votes are mathematically sealed using Poseidon hash commitments. A Groth16 zero-knowledge proof verifies eligibility through a snapshot Merkle tree, confirms correct vote structure, and proves ownership — all without revealing what you voted for. There is no reveal phase. Individual votes are permanently encrypted.',

      howDesc: 'When you vote, a Poseidon commitment locks your choice: H(choice, votingPower, proposalId, salt). A ZK proof then verifies your governance token via Merkle inclusion in a historical snapshot, confirms ownership via Baby Jubjub key derivation, and checks that voting power matches your token balance — without exposing any of these values.',

      desc: 'Traditional "1 token = 1 vote" cannot distinguish mild preferences from strong convictions, and gives whales unchecked power. Quadratic voting fixes both: influence costs grow exponentially, so passionate minorities can outweigh apathetic majorities, while no single entity can dominate outcomes.',
      howTitle: 'How It Works',
      howDesc: 'Each voter receives voice credits. Casting more votes on the same proposal costs quadratically more: cost = votes². One vote costs 1 credit, but 10 votes costs 100 credits. This forces voters to budget their influence across proposals, naturally preventing plutocratic domination while letting conviction shine through.',

      howTitle: 'How It Works',
      howDesc: 'Votes are encrypted via ECDH shared key with the Coordinator and stored in an immutable AccQueue on-chain. During tallying, messages are processed last-to-first.
