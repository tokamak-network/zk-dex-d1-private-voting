      q1: 'Is my vote really private? Can anyone see it?',
      a1: 'Yes, permanently private. There is no reveal phase. Individual votes are cryptographically sealed using Poseidon hash commitments and never decrypted — not even by the coordinator.',
      q2: 'How much does it cost to use?',
      a2: 'Currently free on Sepolia testnet. On Ethereum mainnet, each proof batch costs approximately 300K gas. Voters pay a small gas fee per vote transaction.',
      q3: 'How many voters can participate?',
      a3: 'Up to 1,024 voters per poll with the current configuration (state tree depth 10). This can be scaled by increasing the tree depth.',
      q4: 'Has the code been audited?',
      a4: 'The codebase is fully open source (MIT license) with 116+ automated tests and 7 cryptographic security properties verified. Built on Ethereum PSE MACI research. Community audit and formal audit are planned before mainnet.',
      q5: 'Which blockchains are supported?',
      a5: 'Currently deployed on Ethereum Sepolia testnet. Ethereum mainnet is the primary target. Multi-chain support (Base, Arbitrum) is planned.',
      q6: 'What if someone forces me to vote a certain way?',

      howDesc: 'Votes are encrypted via ECDH shared key with the Coordinator and stored in an immutable AccQueue on-chain. During tallying, messages are processed last-to-first. If you changed your key after being coerced, the coerced vote\'s signature no longer matches — it is silently routed to a null state. The briber cannot tell.',
      scenario: 'Forced Vote (Coerced)',
      step1: 'A briber forces Alice to vote "For" and watches her submit it on-chain. She complies to appear cooperative.',
      step2: 'Alice secretly changes her EdDSA key. The briber cannot detect this — it looks like any other encrypted message.',
      step3: 'Alice re-votes with her true choice using the new key. During reverse-order processing, only this vote counts.',
